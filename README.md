# Transparency in Coverage Data with Python: Part 1

July 1, 2022, the [Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/) (CMS) began enforcing its new [Transparency in Coverage Rule](https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency), which requires almost all US health plans to post very detailed pricing data about the vast majority of the services and procedures these plans cover.

In this Jupyter Notebook series, I will provide code and commentary that enables mere mortals like you and me to draw insights from the Transparency in Coverage datasets that payers have released. Some of this data is quite large - and that's no problem - we'll go through methods using the Open Source programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) to efficiently crawl through these files and extract exactly what we need.

*(The targeted audience for this notebook series is actuaries who have some familiarity with the Python lagnuage, but you can probably also learn as you go if you've not seen it before.)*
