    "# Transparency in Coverage Data with Python: Part 2\n",

    "Hello there! If you are starting with this notebook and have not yet checked out the [introductory notebook in this series]('./tic_start.ipynb'), please do that first. It won't take long, and you'll be better prepared for the content in this notebook.\n",

    "As we left off at the end of the previous notebook, we had defined a parser function to handle TOC files. I've saved off that function in a separate Python file so we can import it, and start off where we left off from Part 1. Let's quickly confirm that it works, because we'll be using it to fetch in-network rates."
