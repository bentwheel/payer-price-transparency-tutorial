    "July 1, 2022, the [Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/) (CMS) began enforcing its new [Transparency in Coverage Rule](https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency), which requires almost all US health plans to post very detailed pricing data about the vast majority of the services and procedures these plans cover.\n",

    "In this Jupyter Notebook series, I will provide code and commentary that enables mere mortals like you and me to draw insights from the Transparency in Coverage datasets that payers have released. Some of this data is quite large - and that's no problem - we'll go through methods using the Open Source programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) to efficiently crawl through these files and extract exactly what we need.\n",

But one challenge here is that we don't know how these items relate to their parent objects, `reporting_structure`. We know there are 6 `reporting_structure` objects within this TOC file, but how do these 139 plans relate to each of the six reporting structures? We'll want to keep track of what `reporting_structure` each `reporting_plans` object belongs to!"

    "\n",
    "But what we just saw here was the same 140 of CareFirst's in-network rate file URLs being copied 6 times for each `reporting_structure` object. This isn't an error on CareFirst's part - this is merely them following the standard set by CMS. In truth, a large reason why these files are so massive is because the data standard prescribed by CMS enforces redundancies like this. I'd hazard a guess that it is likely that those responsible for writing the CMS standard did not expect the in-network rate data to be so absolutely massive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of *this* particular TOC file, CareFirst was unable to bundle all of their `reporting_plan` and `in_network_files` objects under one single `reporting_structure` entry because the `allowed_amount_file` objects differ for each `reporting_structure`. This is due to criteria for being included within the `allowed_amount_file`, which is listed below:\n",

    "Pay attention to that last line - that these variations need to be captured at the plan or issuer level! Since aggregate variations exist at the plan level, there must be six `reporting_structure` items instead of one. This is because all six `reporting_structures` contain `reporting_plans` that refer to the same 140 `in_network_files` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Finishing up with a final join? Or how about not...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's finish our work here by collecting our `reporting_plans` data table as well as our `in_network_files` data table, knowing that we can join their respective subsets at any time on the `reporting_structure_number` field as the join key for both. Joining it all now would be redundant, as it would create a table where the 139 `reporting_plans` each have 140 `file_location` objects, for a total of 139 x 140 = 19,460 rows of mostly redundant info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since your goal at the end of this might be to parse this information and warehouse it in a more efficient storage format, it makes sense to be comfortable with having three datasets that can be joined at any time down the line, if required, vs. a much larger dataset."

    "## TIC-TOC Helper Function\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best parts about having a published standard to which payers are (mostly) adhering is that the Transparency in Coverage (TIC) data always should always be structured the same, no matter what insurer you're getting it from. Thus, all the TOC files in the TIC data should be readable with a generalized function that parses the data in the way we did today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's finish up by building a parse_tic_toc function that takes as input an open file connection, and runs the parse operations we've described here, outputting the items in a 3-tuple of objects for us to reference later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on GZIP Compression\n",
    "URLs from these TiC files generally come to us in two forms - .json files which are compressed in GZIP format, so they have an extension of `.json.gz`, and those which are not compressed, which merely have an extension of `.json`. At first, we want our helper function to have the ability to parse both kinds once the file is downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Extra points if we can even skip downloading the file, and instead stream the contents of these URLs over the HTTPS protocol incrementally through our parser function. We're not there yet, but we'll tackle that task in the next TiC Tutorial Notebook.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is GZIP Helpful Here?\n",
    "I want to note that GZIP compression a so-called \"sliding window\" compression method (please enjoy this [explainer video on the compression algorithm on which gzip is based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goOa3DGezUA)). This means that we can actually parse JSON from within a GZIPped file without uncompressing it entirely on disk first. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this might seem like trivial knowledge now, in the next TiC Tutorial notebook we will encounter some of these super-huge in-network rate files that you've heard about. We're going to tackle a few that are 30 GB compressed. 30 GB is already a file size that is hard to accomodate on most computers. Reinflating compressed GZIP files to their former glory can somtimes mean a file size that is 100 times the size of its compressed form. In this case, 30 GB might become 3,000 GB, or 3 terabytes. This creates challenges for parsing the file, because we'll need to find a way to extract the information we need from these files *without* ingesting them entirely into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the Compression Ratio So Large?\n",
    "As I've mentioned before, due to the highly redundant nature of the CMS standard, the GZIP compression ratio for these files is quite good, averaging around 95% - 99%. Generally, whenever you have lots of repeated information in a text file, GZIP compression ratios are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressed vs. Uncompressed: ¿Por qué no los dos?\n",

    "### Four Passes?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, in our helper method above, we are making four passes over the data. This is a trade-off to consider. Parsing large files takes time, and crawling over a massive file doing string comparisons is time consuming. On the other hand, from a memory management perspective, if we attempt to extract too much data at one time during our pass over the file, we might max out available memory. We have to balance one constraint (time) with the other (memory).\n",
    "\n",
