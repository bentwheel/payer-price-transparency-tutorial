    "# Transparency in Coverage Data For Mere Mortals - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "July 1, 2022, the [Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/) (CMS) began enforcing its new [Transparency in Coverage Rule](https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency), which requires almost all US health plans to post very detailed pricing data about the vast majority of the services and procedures these plans cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook series, I will provide code and commentary that enables mere mortals like you and me to draw insights from the Transparency in Coverage datasets that payers have released. Some of [this data is quite large](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/discussions/528) and it can seem impossible to wrangle, but stick with me and I'll show you how to get around the huge data issue. We'll go through various approaches of ingesting these datasets using the Open Source programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) and other Open Source and (eventually) cloud-based tools to efficiently crawl through these files and extract exactly what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In **Part 1**, this notebook, I will briefly discuss the Transparency in Coverage data standard, focusing on building Python code that can extract data from the TOC (Table of Contents) file as it is defined by the CMS' standard. To do that, we'll need to learn some JSON basics along the way and then write a little Python to download, parse, and interpret JSON files. I'll walk you through all of that in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In **Part 2**, we'll dive deeper, and learn about what makes these files so huge - and how to use streaming and decompression to our advantage. We'll discuss the tradeoff between system resources (such as memory and processing power) and time as we design our parser. We'll also learn about [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), a powerful lightweight [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) that allows us to write data on disk so we can keep our memory usage low as we extract the data from these truly massive files. At the end of Part 2, we'll have extracted never-before-seen negotiated in-network rates out of some pretty large files!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In **Part 3**, we'll continue extracting payer files by turning our attention to providers and provider groups. We'll learn about APIs, and how we can use our new mastery of JSON to combine data we extract from these files with JSON-formatted data we request from the [NPPES NPI API](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api-page).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In **Part 4**, we'll tackle the biggest of the Transparency in Coverage in-network files out there from some of the big national payers, and we'll show how [freely-available / free-tier cloud resources on Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services/) can be used to bridge the gap between single-user computer capabilities and the capabilities afforded to us by a whole cloud arsenal at our fingertips!\n",
    "\n",
    "*(The targeted audience for this notebook series is actuaries who have some familiarity with the Python lagnuage, but you can probably also learn as you go if you've not seen much Python before.)*"

    "## Transparency in Coverage Schema\n",
    "The [CMS has published a guide on Github](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/) that defines how the data required for compliance with the new Transparency in Coverage Rule should be packaged by payers, in accordance with [85 FR 72158](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/27/2019-25011/transparency-in-coverage).\n",

    "\n",
    "Some payers have elected to mask downloadable links through JavaScript wrappers. It is uncertain whether or not this practice will be tolerated as compliant by the CMS in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sure I'm not promoting the total spamming of a particular single health carrier's hosting services by releasing this tutorial, you need to supply your very own link to a health insurer's TOC file in the code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided a list below of some options for TOC files. Please navigate to one of the sites below and obtain a URL for a Table of Contents file from a carrier into the code cell below. Then copy that URL into the cell below. (**Note**: For now, make sure the TOC file you decide to use is *not* compressed. This is something we will learn how to deal with later in this notebook, and also cover in more detail in Part 2. The [CMS has specified in response to an issue raised on Github](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/discussions/59#discussioncomment-642881) that compression is allowed for any machine-readable file published under these rules. I have specified which carriers below are publishing their TOC files in compressed formats, so please steer clear of those for now.)\n",

    "## A quick JSON primer\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is JSON?\n",
    "\n",
    "[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a format that is used to add structure to data. It stands for \"**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation,\" and it is a very popular way to convey data over the internet. Almost all of the services you use every day, such as streaming services, home comfort control services, and generally anything with a public (or private!) API all likely use JSON to transmit and receive data with the consumer devices and interfaces you use to control these services. It is a format that is very human-readable and exceptionally machine-readable, and it offers more versatility in the way data is stored over traditional \"flat\" methods, such a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is rife with great videos about JSON basics, and I'd encourage you to take a moment to watch a few. It won't take more than 10 or 15 minutes to fully grasp the big idea. I personally found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlYiOcMNzyQ) to be very helpful without being *too* technical - but if you want something more technical, you've definitely got options out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bring Your Own Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video I linked above, the author mentioned that **JSON does not provide for any one specific schema**. What does this mean, exactly? JSON provides a syntax or common grammar/language for adding complex structure to data, but exactly *what* that structure is, as well as how that structure is defined and interpreted, is left up to the programmers who are building the programming API or tool. Let's take a look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FHIR and JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a healthcare actuary, you might have heard that [CMS has designated the FHIR HL7 standard as the required means of health data communication between providers, patients, and payers over which they have regulatory authority](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/18/2020-27593/medicaid-program-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-reducing-provider-and-patient-burden-by). In this case, [FHIR HL7](https://build.fhir.org/documentation.html) is the schema or standard - but the language used to structure this schema is often JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "| FHIR Patient Data in Human Readable Diagram      | FHIR Patient Data in JSON  | \n",
    "| :----:      |    :----:   | \n",
    "| ![A screenshot of the FHIR HL7 patient object in a human-readable diagram](./images/FHIR_patient_structure.png \"FHIR HL7 Patient Data Diagram\")      | ![A screenshot of the FHIR HL7 patient object in JSON](./images/FHIR_patient_JSON.png \"FHIR HL7 Patient Data in JSON\")       | \n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example from [the official FHIR HL7 documentation for patient data](https://build.fhir.org/patient.html). On the left, you'll see an image of a very human-readable diagram that shows the how data about a patient is structured heirarchically in a way that makes a lot of sense. This is the data's *schema*, its structure. This has little to do with JSON. Where JSON comes in is on the right: JSON is one particular format we can use to express the data schema so that a machine can easily, quickly, and consistently read the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a payer and you need to make a prior authorization decision on a provider hospital's request to admit a patient into the ER. As part of this request, the provider will send health information to the payer that is relevant to the decision. In the past, this was done in many ways - via fax, over email, using proprietary forms and schemas, etc. The big idea of Interoperability is that all the data anyone could want is structured in the FHIR HL7 schema. And that data can be efficiently broken down, transmitted, and re-assembled in a human-readable way if it's structured in JSON format, among other options."

    "Note that this is object is the lowest \"level\" we can peel back, since every data type here is basically a \"primitive\" data type - which is computer science-speak for a single-valued data type, vs. an array or an object containing other data inside of it. This means that we can make a table that represents the all the Reporting Plans objects, because each item in this array of Reporting Plans objects can be represented as a [Python `dict` type](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Dictionaries), which can be thought of as an individual row in a data table. Since there are presumably *many* Reporting Plans objects, we can iterate over all of of them with our parser and assemble them into a `pandas` DataFrame. "

    "Let's finish our work here by collecting our `reporting_plans` data table as well as our `in_network_files` data table, knowing that we can join their respective subsets at any time on the `reporting_structure_number` field as the join key for both. While JSON can often be \"flattened\" into a traditional table-style format with rows and columns, it doesn't always mean that you *should* do this. In most cases, it would be a very large table with many repeated values. Instead, we should store the three primary objects - `reporting_plans`, `in_network_files` and `allowed_amount_file` - as separate tables, as well as any additional metadata information about the TOC file.\n",

    "## TIC-TOC Helper Function\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best parts about having a published standard to which payers are (mostly) adhering is that the Transparency in Coverage (TIC) data always should always be structured the same, no matter what insurer you're getting it from. Thus, all the TOC files in the TIC data should be readable with a generalized function that parses the data in the way we did today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's finish up by building a parse_tic_toc function that takes as input an open file connection, and runs the parse operations we've described here, outputting the items in a 3-tuple of objects for us to reference later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on GZIP Compression\n",
    "URLs from these TiC files generally come to us in two forms - .json files which are compressed in GZIP format, so they have an extension of `.json.gz`, and those which are not compressed, which merely have an extension of `.json`. At first, we want our helper function to have the ability to parse both kinds once the file is downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Extra points if we can even skip downloading the file, and instead stream the contents of these URLs over the HTTPS protocol incrementally through our parser function. We're not there yet, but we'll tackle that task in the next TiC Tutorial Notebook.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is GZIP Helpful Here?\n",
    "I want to note that GZIP compression a so-called \"sliding window\" compression method (please enjoy this [explainer video on the compression algorithm on which gzip is based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goOa3DGezUA)). This means that we can actually parse JSON from within a GZIPped file without uncompressing it entirely on disk first. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this might seem like trivial knowledge now, in the next TiC Tutorial notebook we will encounter some of these super-huge in-network rate files that you've heard about. We're going to tackle a few that are fairly large, even if compressed. Many of these files come in sizes that are just impossible to accomodate on most computers. Reinflating compressed GZIP files to their former glory can somtimes mean a file size that is 100 times the size of its compressed form. In this case, 30 GB might become nearly 3,000 GB, or 3 terabytes! This creates challenges for parsing the file, because we'll need to find a way to extract the information we need from these files *without* ingesting them entirely into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the Compression Ratio So Large?\n",
    "As I've mentioned before, due to the highly redundant nature of this data, the GZIP compression ratio for these files is quite good, averaging around 95% - 99%. Generally, whenever you have lots of repeated information in a text file, GZIP compression ratios are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressed vs. Uncompressed: ¿Por qué no los dos?\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to build into our `parse_tic_toc` helper function the capability to parse JSON whether it encounters it in compressed or uncompressed format, so we've designed for that with the initial block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if file_path.endswith('.json.gz'):\n",
    "        toc_file = gzip.open('./toc_file_aetna.json.gz', 'rb')\n",
    "    elif file_path.endswith('.json'):\n",
    "        toc_file = open('./toc_file.json')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Expecting a .json or .json.gz file...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want our helper method to open a streaming connection to the file that varies based on the file extension - if it's `.json.gz` then we'll open the file with the method `gzip.open()`, if it's `.json` then we'll simply the standard file reader, and if it's neither, we'll raise an error and halt execution."

Parsing large files takes time, and crawling over a massive file doing string comparisons is time consuming. On the other hand, from a memory management perspective, if we attempt to extract too much data at one time during our pass over the file, we might max out our available memory. We have to balance one constraint (time) with the other (memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll be working with some pretty big files. These files are so big that it might not make a lot of sense to download them to disk. Instead, we can consider streaming them through our JSON parser and collecting only the information we need - which is a much smaller subset of the information in these files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, some of the rate files we will be working with are *so* large that it's not possible to download them to disk, and it's *also* not possible to extract their contents with the memory and disk constraints of your typical single-user computer, so in Part 3 of this tutorial, we'll be expanding our arsenal of tools into the cloud.
